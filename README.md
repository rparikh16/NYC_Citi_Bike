## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create data visualizations on Tableau using business logic from the raw bikeshare data given from NYC Citi Bike.
A set of visualizations were created to:
- Show the length of the time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
- Show the top starting locations of the bike rentals in New York City
- Show the duration of bike rentals for each gender and age group

The data shows us that more users tend to favor the subscription model with lot more men than women using the bikes frequently.

## Summary
Looking at all data visualizations, a clear trend begins to emerge that the bike rental business is sustainable in NYC due to increased subscription users that tend to use the bikes everyday going to and from work, with a higher ratio of men to women. 
Women tend to rent the bikes for a longer duration, however, more men seem to be daily subscribed users. 
The other data also shows that the highest usage areas are in Manhattan which can be due to several reasons including increased tourism and difficultly to drive a car. 
Another trend we can see are that younger generations tend to use the bikes more frequently and higher duration as compared to older generations. 
To summarize all the data, in order for a Bike Rental business like this to be successful in a smaller town of Des Moines, the downtown area with the majority of office buildings would be the best place to start. If there are enough daily users that would take the bikes to and from work, it could be a successful business, however, there are increased risks involved due to lack of tourism and new users.
